# COVID TRACKER

A live demo of this website is available [here](https://covid-tracker-maulik.web.app/)
It is also installable as a PWA (Progressive Web App)

This is a fully functional and beautiful COVID-19 tracker app. It gets the data from [the disease.sh API](https://disease.sh). It can show the recovered cases, deaths and active cases. It also has a map that shows the number of cases in proportion to the circles.

This website uses React, Material-UI (for icons) and Firebase (for hosting only).
